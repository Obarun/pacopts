Name
----
pacopts - system maintainer helper

Synopsis
--------
'pacopts' <operation> [ target ]

Description
-----------
Pacopts is a  utility script written in bash which helps you to find the 
origin of the repositories for installed packages, to maintain the system
automatically for somes repetitives operations by wrapping
{sysusers,tmpfiles}.d coming from systemd and to maintain/manage AUR 
packages using Cower software.

Operations
----------
*origin*::

	Check origin of all installed packages coming from a given 'target'
	where 'target' can be all repositories set in pacman.conf. Pacman
	queries versions of packages; not the origin of packages. For 
	instance a identical package with the same version on different 
	repositories, pacman won't know where the package came from. The 
	version of packages, or a least the release, need to be different to
	let pacman to find the good package. For example, if you build some 
	package from abs and you don't change the version/release, pacman 
	will not find the origin repository and obviously pacopts too.

*applysys*::
	
	Parse 'target' file where 'target' can be found at 
	/usr/lib/sysusers.d, /run/sysusers.d, /etc/sysusers.d. This is 
	operation use the applysys script. see man(1) applysys for more 
	details.

*applytmp*::
	
	This is a tmpfiles.d wrapper for file used by systemd to create
	directory at boot time. This operation doesn't accept any 'target'. 
	Pacopts call the script written by Robin H Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org>
	which parse and apply all files found at /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d. 
	This operation is automatically made by s6-boot at the booting time.
	Pacopts provide an hook for pacman which run this operation 
	automatically at the package installation. This hook is installed at
	/usr/share/libalpm/hooks/applytmp.hook. If you do not want to let 
	pacman using this operation at package installation, just remove this
	file from your system.

*service*::
	
	Check if a service exist for a given 'target' where 'target' is the 
	name of the package to check. If 'target' is empty, all installed
	packages on the system will be checked.
	+
This 'operation' only return service(s) package which are not installed yet.
	+
'target' can be a list.
	
*aur*::

	Maintain/install package(s) coming from AUR. This operation prompt
	you an interactive menu where 'target' command can be info, search, 
	msearch, download, update, build, install, quit (see below).
	This operation *must be* run with normal user to avoid trouble on
	your system when a package is builded. A file $HOME/.config/cower/config
	*must exist* even it empty. This file can be a simple copy of
	/usr/share/doc/cower/config cower configuration file.
+
The 'target' can be called by the first letter of the command e.g. d
for download. A special case exist for install, you need to enter in.
+
The interactive menu displayed look like this :
+
	Manage info : : enter a name >
+
The bold word show you what command you are currently managing, in this
case : info. You can switch between command at every time entering the
desired command. The space between :: and > is used by pacopts to give/ask
you some informations when is needed like overwrite or not a PKGBUILD. 
+
Every command can be apply for a single package or for a list of packages. 
The script look forward a triple dash to define the list e.g :
+		
	Manage info : : enter a name > retrovol clipit ---
+
Without this regex only the first name is took. A whitespace need to be
present before and after the triple dash.
+
The script accept any extra operation coming from cower (see man cower) 
except for the command build and install e.g :
+	
	Manage info : : enter a name > retrovol --format=%D
	Manage info : : enter a name > retrovol clipit --- --format=%D
+
The cower operation help can be called under the command info, search, 
msearch, download, update by entering '-h'.

Aur Command
-----------
*info*::
	
	Show information about package(s).

*search*::
	
	Search package(s) in AUR repositories.

*msearch*::
	
	Search for package(s) maintained by a named maintainer. This is a 
	synonym for searching with --by=maintainer.

*download*::
	
	Download the PKGBUILD of the package(s). The working directory where
	the PKGBUILD is downloaded is set by the variable TargetDir at 
	$HOME/.config/cower/config file. If this variable is empty, /tmp is 
	picked by default.

*update*::
	
	Check packages for updates in the AUR. Without any 'arguments', all 
	installed packages coming from AUR will be checked. With all as
	'arguments', all installed packages coming from AUR will be updated
	on your system, it means : downloaded, builded, installed. 
	The dependencies is recursively checked. Examples :
		
		Manage update : : enter a name >
		Manage update : : enter a name >all
		Manage update : : enter a name >retrovol clipit ---

*build*::
	
	Download the PKGBUILD of the package(s) then build it. 
	The AUR dependencies for the given package(s) is not checked. 
	The working directory where the PKGBUILD is downloaded is set by the
	variable TargetDir at $HOME/.config/cower/config file. If this 
	variable is empty, /tmp is picked by default.

*install*::
	
	Download, build and install the given package(s). If a dependency 
	coming from AUR is detected, the script run again the same scheme 
	(download, build, install) for the dependency. This system is done 
	recursively to find any AUR dependencies for the main package(s).

Files
-----
/etc/obarun/pacopts.conf
